Thanks for the clarification! To align with your requirements, we'll create **two cron jobs** per booking:

1. **Start Cron Job**: It will trigger at the start of the time slot (e.g., 8 AM for the AM slot).
2. **End Cron Job**: It will trigger at the end of the time slot (e.g., 1 PM for the AM slot).

### Updated Logic for Cron Generation:

- For each booking, **two cron jobs** will be created based on the earliest start time and the latest end time across all selected time slots.
- The time slot ranges:
  - **AM**: 8 AM to 1 PM → Start: 8 AM, End: 1 PM.
  - **PM**: 1 PM to 6 PM → Start: 1 PM, End: 6 PM.
  - **Overnight**: 6 PM to 8 AM (next day) → Start: 6 PM, End: 8 AM (next day).

If both **AM** and **PM** are selected, the start cron will be at 8 AM (from AM) and the end cron will be at 6 PM (from PM). Similarly, if **Overnight** is selected, the start will be 6 PM and the end will be 8 AM the next day.

### Updated `generate_cron_expression` Function:

```python
def generate_cron_expression(repeat_days, time_slots):
    cron_entries = []

    # Map repeat_days (e.g., "Tuesday") to crontab day of week numbers
    day_map = {
        "Sunday": 0, "Monday": 1, "Tuesday": 2, "Wednesday": 3,
        "Thursday": 4, "Friday": 5, "Saturday": 6
    }

    # Time slot start and end times
    time_slot_times = {
        "AM": (8, 13),  # Start at 8 AM, end at 1 PM
        "PM": (13, 18),  # Start at 1 PM, end at 6 PM
        "Overnight": (18, 8)  # Start at 6 PM, end at 8 AM the next day
    }

    # Determine the earliest start time and the latest end time based on selected time slots
    start_times = []
    end_times = []

    for time_slot in time_slots:
        start_time, end_time = time_slot_times[time_slot]
        start_times.append(start_time)
        end_times.append(end_time)

    # Get the earliest start time and the latest end time
    earliest_start = min(start_times)
    latest_end = max(end_times)

    # Generate cron expressions for the earliest start and latest end
    for day in repeat_days:
        day_of_week = day_map.get(day)

        # Cron for the start time (trigger when the booking starts)
        cron_start = f"0 {earliest_start} * * {day_of_week}"

        # Cron for the end time (trigger when the booking ends)
        if latest_end == 8:
            # If end time is 8 AM the next day
            cron_end = f"0 8 * * {(day_of_week + 1) % 7}"
        else:
            cron_end = f"0 {latest_end} * * {day_of_week}"

        cron_entries.append(cron_start)
        cron_entries.append(cron_end)

    return cron_entries
```

### Key Points:

1. **Time Slot Mapping**:
    - AM: Start at 8 AM, End at 1 PM.
    - PM: Start at 1 PM, End at 6 PM.
    - Overnight: Start at 6 PM, End at 8 AM the next day.

2. **Calculate the Earliest Start and Latest End**:
   - We loop through the selected time slots and extract the earliest start time and the latest end time.

3. **Cron Job Generation**:
   - Two cron jobs will be created for each repeat day: one for the earliest start time and one for the latest end time.
   - For the **Overnight** slot, the end cron will be on the next day (`cron_end` handles this by using `(day_of_week + 1) % 7` to move to the next day in the week).

### Full Updated `save_booking` View:

```python
def save_booking(request):
    if request.method == 'POST':
        try:
            # Get the date range from the form and split it into start and end dates
            date_range = request.POST.get('dateRange')
            start_date, end_date = date_range.split(' - ')
            start_date = datetime.strptime(start_date, '%d/%m/%Y').date()
            end_date = datetime.strptime(end_date, '%d/%m/%Y').date()

            # Collect other form data
            new_scheme_types = request.POST.getlist('schemeType')  # Scheme types
            new_time_slots = request.POST.getlist('timeSlot')  # Time slots (AM, PM, Overnight)
            new_repeat_days = request.POST.getlist('repeatBooking')  # Repeat days (e.g., Tuesday)

            # Generate the cron expressions
            cron_entries = generate_cron_expression(new_repeat_days, new_time_slots)

            # Collect other form data to store in the booking
            booking_data = {
                'project_name': request.POST.get('projectName'),
                'psp_name': request.POST.get('pspName'),
                'owner': request.POST.get('owner'),
                'server': request.POST.get('server'),
                'scheme_types': new_scheme_types,
                'start_date': start_date.strftime('%d/%m/%Y'),
                'end_date': end_date.strftime('%d/%m/%Y'),
                'time_slots': new_time_slots,
                'repeat_days': new_repeat_days,
                'cron_jobs': cron_entries  # Save the cron expressions
            }

            # Ensure the config directory exists
            CONFIG_DIR.mkdir(parents=True, exist_ok=True)

            # Load the existing bookings data from the JSON file (if exists)
            if BOOKINGS_FILE.exists():
                with BOOKINGS_FILE.open('r') as file:
                    try:
                        bookings = json.load(file)
                    except json.JSONDecodeError:
                        bookings = []  # In case the file is empty or invalid
            else:
                bookings = []

            # Generate a new booking ID (increment the last one)
            if bookings:
                booking_id = max(b['booking_id'] for b in bookings) + 1
            else:
                booking_id = 1
            booking_data['booking_id'] = booking_id

            # Add the new booking to the list
            bookings.append(booking_data)

            # Write the updated list back to the JSON file
            with BOOKINGS_FILE.open('w') as file:
                json.dump(bookings, file, indent=4)

            return HttpResponse("Booking saved successfully!")
        except Exception as e:
            return HttpResponseBadRequest(f"Error saving booking: {str(e)}")

    return HttpResponseBadRequest("Invalid request method.")
```

### Example Cron Expressions:

1. **For AM Slot on Tuesday**:
    - Start cron at 8 AM on Tuesday: `"0 8 * * 2"`.
    - End cron at 1 PM on Tuesday: `"0 13 * * 2"`.

2. **For PM Slot on Thursday**:
    - Start cron at 1 PM on Thursday: `"0 13 * * 4"`.
    - End cron at 6 PM on Thursday: `"0 18 * * 4"`.

3. **For Overnight Slot on Monday**:
    - Start cron at 6 PM on Monday: `"0 18 * * 1"`.
    - End cron at 8 AM on Tuesday: `"0 8 * * 2"` (the next day).

4. **For AM and PM on Tuesday**:
    - Start cron at 8 AM on Tuesday: `"0 8 * * 2"`.
    - End cron at 6 PM on Tuesday: `"0 18 * * 2"`.

### Summary:

- This logic ensures that **two cron jobs** are generated for each booking: one at the start time and one at the end time.
- The start and end times are based on the selected **time slots** and **repeat days**.
- The cron jobs are saved in the `bookings.json` file and can be used to trigger a script like `booking.sh`.
